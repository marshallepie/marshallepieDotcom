    <h2>Training Philosophy</h2>
    <p>Martial arts, to me, is not just about self-defense. It's about discovering how to move with intention, clarity, and grace. I teach a system that values precision over power, presence over pressure—rooted in a deep belief that minimal movement can lead to maximum effect.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>My Approach</h2>
    <p>I don’t just teach technique—I guide people through the philosophy of movement. Each session combines physical training with reflective understanding. We learn not only how to act, but when to wait. Not just how to fight, but how to flow.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Turning Point</h2>
    <p>One of the most powerful lessons in my martial journey came from a conflict with a teacher. It led me to write a poem that still resonates today:</p>
    <blockquote>
      "My love, regardless..."
    </blockquote>
    <p>This poem is more than a memory. It’s a message—about pride, humility, and choosing peace over ego.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Art of Laziness</h2>
    <p>My book-in-progress, <em>The Art of Laziness</em>, is rooted in these ideas. It's a reflection on mastery, technology, and ease—told through stories, like the fight in Brixton, where doing less meant winning more.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Get in Touch</h2>
    <p>If you'd like to train with me or explore these ideas in motion, <a href="mailto:contact@marshallepie.com">send me a message</a>.</p>
